[RE]Settle is a Comparative Analysis of Human Settlements in Rio de Janeiro and Mumbai.

Both Rio and Mumbai have been reforming their global image - In the case of Rio, the state is trying to attract and drive foreign investment through mega events, whereas Mumbai strives to do the same, but by branding itself as a global financial hub and as a hub of production. However, with these large reformations happening on the ground, resettlement of the urban poor has become a dominating narrative.

[RE]Settle gives a snapshot of some of the underlying factors contributing to the resettlement of residents from their informal settlements.
