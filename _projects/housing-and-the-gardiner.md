This map is to visualize how the city of Toronto is spending money in two areas: the Gardiner Expressway, and Housing for low income and the homeless (ex. community housing and shelters).

On the map you can see the darker colors, the oldest housing stock, that will need repairs immediately.

Elevated expressways in western cities across the world have been demolished or they are in the process of removing them. Boston dug theirs, New York City removed the West High Way, and San Franciscoâ€™s earthquake destroyed most of the Embarcadero but the city removed the rest of it. This map is a case study to see if the money planned for the Eastern section of the Gardiner Expressway could go into public housing instead. This idea was mentioned by former chief planner Paul Bedford, council member Gord Perks, and other individuals involved in the 2015 Gardiner debate.
